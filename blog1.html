            <p>
                Varahi is one of the Matrikas, a group of seven mother goddesses in Hinduism. She embodies the feminine energy (shakti) of Varaha, the boar avatar of the god Vishnu. Here are some key points about Varahi:

Appearance: Varahi has the head of a sow and a human body with eight arms. She is often depicted riding a buffalo.
Origins: According to Hindu texts, Varahi was created from Varaha (the boar form of Vishnu). She wields a chakra (discus) and fights with a sword.
Worship: Varahi is venerated in Shaktism (Goddess-oriented worship), Shaivism (devotees of Shiva), and Vaishnavism (devotees of Vishnu). She is usually worshipped at night using secretive Vamamarga Tantric practices1.
Other Names: In Nepal, she is known as Barahi, and in Rajasthan and Gujarat, she is revered as Dandini.
Significance: Varahi is considered a granter of boons and the regent of the Northern direction. She plays a role in the battle against demons, as described in various Hindu scriptures12.
Remember that Varahi‚Äôs worship is deeply rooted in Hindu tradition, and she holds a unique place among the divine feminine energies. üåüüôè
